"# HITJavaProject-CLIENT" 

Client side of the project. You must run MVCDriver for the gui.
Instructions:
In order to search for "jobs" -> click the "Search Engine" button. Choose by which parameter you wish to search (for example: city) and type in your request in the text field (for example: Holon). The program uses a debouncer so no need for additonal approvement of your request, the desired result should appear in the window as a table.
If nothing appears, your request wasnt found in the database (a json file).

In order to add/delete "jobs" -> click the "Add New Jobs" button. Fill in the desired paramters in the text fields and click "Add Job".
If you wish to delete a job, it is done by supplying the id of the relevant job you wish to delete. Fill in the text field right next to "Remove by ID" with the id you wish to remove.
